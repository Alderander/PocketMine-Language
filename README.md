# PocketMine-Language

These files contain translation strings used in PocketMine-MP.

### Adding new strings
Only English should be modified directly. To add new strings, add them ONLY to eng.ini. Crowdin will then synchronize them with itself and the new strings will be put up for translation within Crowdin.

### Contributing translations
To contribute translations, please use the [Crowdin Translation Page](http://translate.pocketmine.net/) and go to PocketMine-MP -> Base
